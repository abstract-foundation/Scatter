# Rivative Network
The Rivative Network is a decentralized cryptographically secured network of peer-to-peer nodes exchanging "messages" between each other. The Rivative Network allows anyone to build any kind of "ledger" or smart contract platform on top of it. The Rivative Network uses Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm to settle and record messages in a secure distributed database without a central operator.

# XRV
XRV is esigned to be the "gas" token of the Rivative Network. There is no limited supply of XRV (This would result in extravagent gas fees), instead there are supply caps. Nodes on the network vote to either shorten supply, stay the same or highten supply every three months. (There is a pre-mint of 100,000,000 XRV)

# Key Features of the Rivative Network
- Allows users to create complex decentralized applications at low costs.
- Allows users to create custom ledgers without the need of starting their own network.
