# Rivative Network Domains: A Decentralized Message and Transaction Management System

## Version: 0.0.1-beta

## Introduction:
In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain and decentralized networks, the Rivative Network introduces a unique concept called "Domains." These Domains are designed to facilitate message storage and transaction management within the network, offering both public (.pub) and private (.priv) options to suit various needs. This article will delve deeper into the concept of Rivative Domains, their registration process, and their role in custom ledger implementations.

## Understanding Rivative Domains:
In the Rivative Network, Domains serve as distinct spaces within the decentralized ecosystem. They enable users to organize and manage messages in separate "trees," enhancing data organization and access control. When a message is initially created, it is stored in the default domain, which is publicly accessible as xrv.pub. However, users have the option to create their own domains, either as public or private, depending on their requirements.

## Private Domains (.priv): 
These domains are accessible to a designated set of nodes chosen by the creator. Public Domains are ideal for scenarios where specific nodes need to manage the domain efficiently. This approach often leads to reduced gas fees, making it cost-effective for message handling.

## Registering a Domain:
To encourage active participation and domain creation within the network, Rivative allows users to register domains. The registration process involves a fee, which helps maintain network integrity and sustainability:

## Public Domain Registration:
Users can register a public domain for a fee of 100 XRV. Public domains, once registered, can be managed by the designated nodes, offering enhanced control and cost-efficiency.

## Private Domain Registration:
For users who require a higher level of privacy and control, private domains can be registered for a fee of 1000 XRV. Private domains are exclusively managed by the owner, ensuring utmost confidentiality and control over their data.

## Custom Ledger Implementation via Domains:
One of the core functionalities of Rivative Domains is their role in custom ledger implementations. Since the Rivative Network does not have a predefined ledger or transaction system, it empowers users to create their custom ledgers within specific domains. This flexibility allows users to tailor transaction processing to their unique requirements.

## Gas Fee Optimization:
In the Rivative Network, gas fees can be paid on behalf of the message sender. This presents an opportunity for custom ledgers to optimize gas fee management. Here's how it works:

## Custom Ledger Issuance:
When a custom ledger is created within a domain, it can issue its own gas tokens. These tokens are used to pay for gas fees associated with transactions within that domain.

## Exchange for XRV: 
To cover gas fees, the custom ledger can exchange its gas tokens for XRV, the native currency of the Rivative Network. This mechanism ensures smooth and cost-effective transaction processing within the network.

## Illustrating the Process:
Consider the example of a public domain, "matic.pub," and its relationship with the custom ledger and gas fees:

A message is sent to the "matic.pub" domain.
The custom ledger within "matic.pub" handles the message, issuing gas tokens and managing gas fee reserves.
Gas fees incurred during the transaction are paid using the gas tokens issued by the custom ledger.
If needed, the custom ledger can exchange its gas tokens for XRV to maintain adequate gas fee reserves.

## Conclusion:
Rivative Domains introduce a dynamic and versatile approach to message storage and transaction management within the decentralized Rivative Network. Whether for public or private use, these domains empower users to organize their data efficiently and implement custom ledgers to optimize gas fee handling. This innovative concept paves the way for a more flexible and user-centric blockchain ecosystem, fostering creativity and adaptability among network participants.
